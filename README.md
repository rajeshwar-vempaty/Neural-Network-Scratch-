# Neural-Network-Scratch-
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to implement a neural network from scratch. The notebook is designed to provide a comprehensive guide to understand the underlying mechanics of neural networks, without using any machine learning frameworks.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.x**: The code is written in Python 3. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: The Python package installer. Usually comes bundled with Python 3.x.
- **Virtual Environment (Optional)**: This is recommended for isolating project dependencies. You can use `venv` or `conda` to create a virtual environment.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux), navigate to the folder where you want to store the project, and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Folder

Change your current directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd YourRepositoryName
```

#### 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

To create a virtual environment, run:

```bash
# Using venv
python3 -m venv your-env-name

# Using conda
conda create --name your-env-name python=3.x
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# Using venv (Windows)
your-env-name\Scripts\Activate

# Using venv (macOS/Linux)
source your-env-name/bin/activate

# Using conda
conda activate your-env-name
```

#### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you should manually install the necessary libraries mentioned in the notebook or code.

#### 5. Launch Jupyter Notebook

Run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook `Neural_Network_Scratch.ipynb` and run all the cells to see the project in action.
